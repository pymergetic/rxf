# RXF — Reversible eXecutable Format

One file that boots directly, carries its whole program state as an object graph, can
be read and written through a path namespace from outside and from inside, and can
produce a checked successor generation of itself.

**This repo (`pymergetic/rxf`) is the external toolchain pill** — a stdlib-only Python
package that mints, inspects, replays, and certifies state binaries. The contained
runtime (cell heap, node table, journal, boot) lives in the companion
[metalpython](https://github.com/pymergetic/metalpython) repo under
`extmod/metal/` and `extmod/wasmmod/`. The two trees share the same docs; paths
into the metal tree are qualified as such below.

The filing this documents is `EINREICHUNG-GESAMT-V4-SIGNED` / `STATE-BINARY-2026`,
"Unmittelbar startbares Zustands-Binärartefakt mit identitätsgebundener
Code-Dateisystem-Schnittstelle" (10 claims). The lifecycle *around* the artifact —
measure, derive a need, bind a change contract, build a variant in staging, canary it,
let a separate gate accept it, activate transactionally — is the companion filing
`METAL-PLASMID-2026` and is out of scope here except where the two meet
(`07-SUCCESSOR-AND-ACTIVATION.md`).

## Reading order

| Doc | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| `01-OBJECT-MODEL.md` | What is an object, what is its id, how does the root drill down |
| `02-CONTAINER.md` | What the file looks like and what boot does with it |
| `03-ALLOCATOR-STATE.md` | The cell heap and domains: why there is no allocator state to image |
| `04-REFERENCES.md` | How one object names another, and why that removes `dlsym` |
| `05-SEMANTIC-AUTHORITY.md` | What replaces text source as the meaning of the program |
| `06-PATHS-AND-VIEWS.md` | The path namespace, generated views, and writing one back |
| `07-SUCCESSOR-AND-ACTIVATION.md` | Delta, dependency closure, boot check, journal, generation swap |
| `08-INVENTORY.md` | Evidence: what the tree has today, with file and line, and what it lacks |
| `09-PLAN.md` | Stages, each with a prove on every seat |
| `10-FACE-AND-CHANNELS.md` | The one door: the VFS face's rank, its ops, and the channel bindings |
| `11-BOOTSTRAP-AND-QUORUM.md` | Germline and soma, the porting ladder, and the permanent external quorum |
| `12-AUTHORING.md` | Models, templates, and the one format: how content gets written before self-editing |

`08-INVENTORY.md` is the one to read first if you want to know how far away this is.
The short version: the *tools* mostly exist (an in-image C compiler, an in-image
Rust-to-C compiler, an ELF relocator, a runtime type catalog, an embedded source
tree, generation-checked handles), and the *state* almost entirely does not (no
cell heap, no object directory, no journal, no durable write path at all).

## The one idea

Everything is an object, and there is exactly one way to name one: a node id.

A node has a kind, a parent, ordered children, a name, a type, a location, and a
generation. That is the whole model. A type is a node. A function is a node. A code
body compiled for one target is a node under that function. A live counter in a heap
is a node. A capacity knob is a node under the card that owns it. A section of the
file is a node. The node table itself is a node.

Three structural decisions sharpen that model, and the rest follows:

- **Every byte of object memory is inside a cell** — one common object type whose
  header is simultaneously allocator metadata, directory entry and type back-pointer
  (`03`). Because references are ids, objects are compactable, and the heap needs no
  free lists: allocation is a domain bump, reclaim is domain retirement, boot copies
  spans and restores frontiers. There is no allocator state to image.
- **The face is the only door** (`10`). The path-op face ranks *above* the
  programmatic API: the kernel, the Python binding, HTTP, FTP and boot's own
  resolution are all clients of one chokepoint, so external mount (62) and internal
  self-view (63) are one implementation with two transports — and "runs as a real OS
  or as a program" is a property of who implements the mediator, not of the artifact.
- **Git is the germline, the lineage is the soma** (`11`). The repo holds the defining
  level and never evolves in place; a lineage evolves through journaled deltas and is
  a pure function of `(seed commit, journal)` — replayable, certifiable, disposable.
  The external toolchain — a stdlib-only Python package whose entire trusted computing
  base is the repo and CPython — mints the seed, ports inward one byte-exact fixed
  point at a time, and remains forever as the quorum's second member: maximally
  independent (interpreted Python vs contained C) and the human-readable oracle at
  every rung.

And the consequences already fixed:

- A **path** is the chain of names from the root, so the path namespace is not a
  second table to keep in sync — it is a view of the tree. (The patent permits a
  path map; deriving it is one way of having one.)
- A **reference** is a node id plus a sub-offset, never an address, so an image is
  position-independent by construction and "linking" is resolving ids against layout
  records rather than looking up symbol names in a host process.
- A **generated view** is a projection of a subtree, and writing it back means
  parsing it and mapping the result onto the ids it came from — surviving nodes keep
  their ids, new nodes get fresh ones, deletions are recorded as ids that went away.
- A **successor generation** is: a delta over node ids, the dependency closure of
  those ids, every affected record rewritten together, then a boot check, then
  acceptance. Unchanged regions are taken byte for byte.

## Three non-negotiables

**Nothing may die where it should refuse.** The artifact contains its own compiler,
and its out-of-room paths must be typed refusals. This one already holds in-tree: the
nomem escape is armed around every compile path — `tcc_set_nomem_jmp` per instance,
setjmp at each object/wasm compile entry (`jit/c/__impl__.c`, vendored
`externals/tcc/libtcc.c:313`) — and the prove exists (squeezed arena -> loud refusal
naming the cause -> healthy arena still compiles, `jit/c/__tests__.c`). A
self-rebuilding artifact whose build step can kill the running generation has no
loop.

**No capacity is a static reservation.** Every limit is a knob under the card that
owns it — soft, hard, default, live-used — movable at runtime from C, C++, Rust and
Python (`src/pymergetic/util/limits/`, mirrored in wasmmod). The node table, the
section table, the journal and the view buffers all follow that rule. A default is
where a state starts, not where it stops.

**Every seat, in the same change.** Host C, unix µPy, emcc browser, and all four
firmware boards — and, for the artifact itself, the phase split of `11`: the external
toolchain proves on every host a wheel reaches, and the contained core proves per
seat as it ports inward. The single largest structural gap in the tree is exactly a
host-only capability: in-kernel linking needs `dlopen`, `mmap(MAP_32BIT)` and
`/proc/self/maps`, so the four boards refuse it outright
(`src/pymergetic/metal/build/__impl__.c:1599`, "link: no loader on this seat").
The id-based reference model in `04-REFERENCES.md` is what closes that gap.

## Naming

The format is **RXF — Reversible eXecutable Format** ("reversible" = successors are
checked deltas over node ids, replayable and certifiable; "executable" = it boots).
One spelling everywhere, the house pattern (`tar`, `zip`, `sqlite`): file extension
`.rxf`, repo `pymergetic/rxf`, package and CLI `rxf` (`pip install rxf`, `rxf replay`).
The name rhymes with ELF on purpose — ELF froze the executable at link time; RXF is the
executable whose state stays alive and journaled. Checked free on PyPI; the four legacy
`.rxf` extension squatters (roof geometry, GPS routes, recipes, REIMSnet XML) are
document/data formats outside the executable/systems space. "State binary" remains the
*description* of the artifact; RXF is its name.

## Provisional naming

Card names are proposals, not decisions. The split follows where the work has to run:

| Proposed card | Impl | Lives in | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pymergetic.state` | c | wasmmod | cell heap, node table, ids, kinds, tree walk, name table, layout records |
| `pymergetic.state.image` | c | wasmmod | container header/section table, reader, checker, writer |
| `pymergetic.state.view` | c | wasmmod | view generation and identity-preserving write-back |
| `pymergetic.metal.state.boot` | c | metal | the seat fill: materialize an image, bind resources, hand over |
| `pymergetic.metal.state.store` | c | metal | durable write: block device, journal, generation swap |

The first three sit in wasmmod so the metal-less seats (`packages/micropython-wasmmod`)
get them too; only the last two need a board. The external toolchain is a separate
pill, not a card: the `rxf` repo, a stdlib-only Python package distributed as a wheel,
per `11`. Names use the ABI convention already in force: `init` pairs with `deinit`,
`create` with `destroy`, and `fini` is not a word.

## Status

Design only. No artifact code has been written — neither in this repo (the external
toolchain) nor in the metal tree (the contained runtime: cell heap, node directory,
journal, successor formatter). Phase A of `11-BOOTSTRAP-AND-QUORUM.md` is the first
thing to build.
